# Hand Written Character Classifier
The following project uses 3 different machine learning algorithms to classify a set of hand written characters.
- Decision Tree (DecisionTreeClassifier)
- Naive Bayes (BernoulliNB)
- Neural Network (MLPClassifier)

## Requirements
Have python version 3.7.0

## Generate prediction dataset
Clone this project

Run the following for decision tree:
`python decision_tree.py` To generate prediction according to training data from dataset1  
`python naive_bayes.py` To generate prediction according to training data from dataset1  
`python neural_network.py` To generate prediction according to training data from dataset1  
  
`python decision_tree2.py` To generate prediction according to training data from dataset2  
`python naive_bayes2.py` To generate prediction according to training data from dataset2  
`python neural_network2.py` To generate prediction according to training data from dataset2  
  
The models will be saved under the /models folder  
  
The predictions will be generated in the /predictions folder
